# Percepteron-learning

Welcome, in this repository i'm going to make a python code that uses an algorithm to gives the user the appropriate weight for each node while counting number of iterations
In this code the user is asked to input x, y, and target values with the threshold, initial weights, and Learning rate (if there's)
